<p>There are many people who raise questions like: Where do I initiate my Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) R12 upgrade, and how do I enhance its performance?<br />
For the starters, these are the queries we always try to answer in our planning discussions. Many have been through prior upgrades of Oracle EBS, but significance of the R12 upgrade makes it a vastly different experience, requiring new approaches from those used in the past.</p>
<p><strong> Sounds interesting..</strong><br />
<span id="more-6044"></span>When you take that first copy of your 11i environment, often the database administrators (DBAs) will be accountable for composing a checklist and implement the technical upgrade against the checklist to ensure that patches and upgrade steps are completed in the applicable order. What is vital and conflict from previous upgrades is the understanding of also having and pursuing a functional checklist that includes pre- and post-upgrade steps.<br />
So, where do you go for advice to help youself develop a pre- and post-upgrade functional checklist? There are various places.<br />
First, Oracle provides the EBS R12.1 Information Center (ID XXXXX.1) on My Oracle Support, which contains all current testament for Release 12.1. If you are migrating from 11i to Release 12.1.3, you can analyse the Oracle E-Business Suite Upgrade Guide Release 11i to 12.1.3, which contains functional pre- and post-upgrade steps by module.</p>
<p>Another option is to appoint consultants who know the necessary steps from prior upgrade exposure.<br />
There are many Oracle special interest groups related to your industry or specific Oracle applications, can be invaluable in the planning exercise. Presence in these groups offers many pathways to explore while planning and executing the R12 upgrade. Through these openings, one can check the significance of having a pre- and post -upgrade checklist as well as what tools to use to create one.<br />
The below given areas are cynical by providing a usable post-upgrade environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">If you are running Accounts Payable, it is critical that you run the 11i &#8212; Payables Accounting Health Check (ID YYYYY.1) and work to resolute issues with current 11i data through Service Requests with Oracle Support prior to upgrading the data in R12. In 11i, this is run via SQL PLUS as APAtgHealthCheck.sql. Once in Release 12, it is run from the Oracle Diagnostics responsibility. You can upgrade without running the health check, but doing so can help you analyze and exclude the origin of ongoing data corruption issues in your Accounts Payable environment into go live. Cleansing up this data in foremost minimises the risk of corrupted AP data in your upgraded R12 environment.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Either before the clone is taken for upgrade, or in the cloned environment but before technical upgrade steps begin, it is key that functional staff ensure that all financial transactions are removed out of the interface tables by running applicable jobs and settling errors.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">In line with the above qualification, it is desirable to execute the upgrade at the start of a fiscal period so as to be able to completely close the financial month and clear out all transactions, moving into the new period clean so as not to encounter issues with transactions migrating from 11i to 12.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">A functional verdict needs to be made in the pre-upgrade steps as to the amount of Subledger Accounting data to be saved. As a default, the upgrade changes the data of the current fiscal year plus any vital for the prior fiscal year to ensure that there are six periods included in the upgrade. If you want to convert more than this, then the DBAs need to apply patch 233248 to your Release 11i APPL_TOP and submit the SLA Pre-Upgrade program.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Eliminate custom folders from users and responsibilities to avoid corruption to these in the upgraded environment. It will be compelling to have users re-create any custom folders in the new R12 instance.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">If you are executing Oracle Enterprise Asset Management, you must have Install Base in your 11i environment before starting the upgrade.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Diagnose key Oracle reports and queries to run, which will be used for post upgrade sanction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;<br />
The above are a few of the key, functional duties to meditate as you prepare your environment for upgrade. There are many ways to shape this checklist for your company&#8217;s upgrade, based on the specific EBS footprint at your site. The key is to prepare a comprehensive list of these activities and the appropriate timing for them in the upgrade, which will be reusable for each R12 instance built in the path of the project.</p>

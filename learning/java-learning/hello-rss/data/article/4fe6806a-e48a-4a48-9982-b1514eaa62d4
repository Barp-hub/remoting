Oracle 11gR2 Cluster requires ASM and Voting disks in ASM disk groups. There is no option to use raw devices for OCR and Voting disks, from a fresh Oracle 11gR2 RAC installation. However, OCR and Voting disks are still allowed to stay on raw devices with an upgrade to 11g RAC. You would see OCR and Voting disks on raw devices in many 10g RAC installations. So, these raw devices can still be working after 11gR2 RAC upgrade.<br><br>RAW devices are a big &quot;NO!!!&quot; these days. Mostly because OS (starting with OEL 5 or RHEL 5) doesn&#39;t natively support raw devices. Raw devices basically came into existence for direct IO operations (to bypass OS cache). Direct IO operations support heavy writing operations. However, these days Linux kernels support direct IO operations even on a cooked file system. So, it eliminates the need for Raw devices.<br><br>After upgrading to 11gR2 RAC from 10g RAC, you may want to move away from raw devices and eventually shutdown the &quot;rawdevices&quot; service. This article explains how to move OCR, Voting, and regular ASM disk groups away from raw devices. Cluster needs to access OCR and Voting disks before even starting the ASM instance.. So, it needs ASMLib to support OCR and Voting on ASM Disk groups.<br><br><a href="http://www.freeoraclehelp.com/2011/09/convert-raw-devices-to-asmlib-move-ocr.html#more">Read more Â»</a>

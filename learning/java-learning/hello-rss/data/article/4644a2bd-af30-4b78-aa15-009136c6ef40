Due to Microsoft's end of support for Internet Explorer browser older versions, you might be looking to update to the latest supported release for your deployed desktop. Considering that XP is already out of support, the most common one is use is Windows 7. For it, the most recent version to use is Internet Explorer 11.<br />
<br />
As per Oracle (Metalink Doc ID 389422.1, Recommended Browsers for Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12), IE 11 is supported, with various patches available for the tech stack and specific products.<br />
<br />
For the tech stack, the biggest patch is 12.1.3 release update pack, so being in a lower version implies a big patching effort. Other than that, some Framework and Application Object Library ones are required.<br />
<br />
On specific products, patching is only needed if you use them: CRM, Web ADI, Report Manager.<br />
<br />
Is it mandatory to upgrade to internet explorer 11?<br />
No, but if you are concerned about security, this can leave you with a vulnerable product for which no patches will be provided.<br />
<br />
Do I lose support for older versions of the browser if I apply the compatibility patches?<br />
No, backward compatibility is maintained. This is useful if there might still be cases where older products are used (e.g. kiosks, integration with third party vendors not compatible yet).<br />
<br />
What about Java?<br />
Java is used to launch the forms GUI, the compatibility patches are to deal with web based products (e.g. OA Framework). As per the referenced Metalink note, JRE 1.6 is supported.<br />
<br />
Then why was I required to update my java version?<br />
You likely applied Critical Patch Updates that install new versions on the server to patch vulnerabilities, and this can require you to upgrade the desktop version to match.<br />
<br />
But I really need to use a past desktop java version...<br />Take a look at using a dynamic CLID on Doc ID 393931.1, Deploying JRE (Native Plug-in) for Windows Clients in Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12:<div>

<i><span style="font-size: x-small;">"there is the additional option of using the 'Dynamic' or 'Family' CLSID in your configuration if required. The CLSID value is applicable to Internet Explorer users only.</span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Dynamic CLSID will attempt to call the latest version from the highest Java family installed on the desktop.</span></i></div>
<div class="kmindent2" style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-left: 80px;">
<i><span style="font-size: x-small;">For example: If you have both JRE 1.7.0_85 and JRE 1.8.0_51 installed, Java content will always launch using JRE 1.8.0_51</span></i></div>
<div class="kmindent1" style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-left: 40px;">
<i><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Family CLSID will attempt to call the latest version of a particular Java family installed on the desktop.</span></i></div>
<div class="kmindent2" style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-left: 80px;">
<i><span style="font-size: x-small;">For example: User A is running JRE 1.7.0_79 while User B is running JRE 1.7.0_85. Each user will be able to launch the same Java content using the particular version they have installed."</span></i></div>

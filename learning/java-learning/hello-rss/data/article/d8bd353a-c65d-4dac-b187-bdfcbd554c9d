<p>Oracle Purchasing mandates that some kind of document routing method be used for approval of purchase documents in oracle apps. Document security, routing and approval is controlled by document type. These documents are routed to certain kinds of hierarchies for approval, and hence, these can also be called as approval hierarchies, which can be classified into 2 types:</p>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> 1) Position based hierarchy:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8211; Obey position relationship.<br />
&#8211; Oracle Purchasing uses ‘position’ as a roadmap to determine how and where the documents will be routed once the approval process has been initiated.</p>

<p><em><strong>Pros of using Position hierarchy:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming Human Resources is installed and the data is being maintained, purchasing can make an employee representation of the position approval hierarchy by simply running the Fill Employee Hierarchy process. This will allow changes occurring in personnel assignments to be updated in the position approval hierarchy.</li>
<li>Documents can get hung up less frequently due to the lower volume of structural hierarchy changes compared to the higher volume of personnel changes that typically occur in companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Cons:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot be used with jobs, but must be used with positions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>2) Employee/Supervisor based hierarchy:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8211; Obeys a hierarchy for document routing, which is based solely on employee and the supervisor relation which is defined in the ‘enter person’ window.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pros of using Employee supervisor hierarchy:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Allows flexibility of establishing approval groups around either jobs or positions.</li>
<li>Assuming Oracle Human Resources (HR) is installed and the data is being maintained, Purchasing uses the supervisor name on the employee record which should be entered and maintained for HR purposes already.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Cons:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Documents may not travel by the employee/supervisor relationship for approval purposes, but take a different path in part or entirely.</li>
<li>Documents can get hung up more frequently due to the volume of personnel changes that typically occur in companies.</li>
<li>Higher volumes of documents need to be re-routed using the Forward-To settings. Recall that the first name alphabetically appears as the default.</li>
</ul>

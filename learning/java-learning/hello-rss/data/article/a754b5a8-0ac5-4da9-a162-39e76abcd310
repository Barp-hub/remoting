This article explains step by step RAC upgrade procedure to upgrade Oracle 10gR2 (10.2.0.4) Real Application Cluster(RAC) to Oracle 11gR2 (11.2.0.2) RAC. This procedure cannot be used for a fresh RAC installation. The following are important notes:<br><ul><li>CRS has to be upgraded first, followed by the database upgrade</li><li>Oracle 11gR2 RAC has brought in a some good changes. Oracle 10g CRS and ASM homes are no more.  Both CRS and ASM are installed in to the same home, GRID Infrastructure home. SCAN is introduced. </li><li>In 11g, OCR and Voting disks can be stored in ASM Disk group</li><li>RAW Devices for OCR and Voting disk are still supported on upgraded RAC environments. This is not an option during a fresh install.</li><li>New user for CRS and ASM administration is introduced. ie. grid user. This is more of a role management for storage guys. It has to be the same OS user in Oracle 10g.</li><li>However, since this is an upgrade, I had to retain the same user for grid. Of course, during fresh installation, you can still run both Grid and Oracle database with the same user.. but oracle recommends a separate user for grid.</li><li>Grid home should not be under grid base</li><li>Oracle database home should be under Oracle base.</li><li>11gR2 introduced a multicasting mechanism for cluster communications.  Verify if your network supports multicast before the upgrade: Refer to Oracle Note: 1212703.1</li><li>Starting with 11gR2, we don’t have to install base release and apply patch sets. For example: In Oracle 10g, we have to install 10.2.0 and then apply 10.2.0.4 patch set on top of 10.2.0. But now, we can directly install 11.2.0.2 from the media.  This may not be found in OTN, check for the patch: 10098816 in My Oracle Support.</li><li>You can opt to run ASMCA after grid installation.. I did not opt for it, because that&#39;s mainly for rolling upgrade. There is no rolling upgrade from 10.2.0.4, so I don&#39;t see any benefit to run ASMCA manually after the grid installation.</li></ul><a href="http://www.freeoraclehelp.com/2011/09/oracle-11gr2-rac-upgrade-from-10gr2-rac.html#more">Read more »</a>

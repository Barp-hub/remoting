<p>When a header attribute is updated and the lines are entered, any header changes are cascaded down to the lines. In the reconfiguration flow, the header information will be derived from the item instance that was selected, together with any Oracle Order Management defaulting rules. Because the header information defaults from the information available for the selected item instance in the installed base, there is a high possibility that the header information will need to be updated after the order is created and/or Booked For this reason, it is necessary to provide an option to cascade many of the changes to the order header to the respective fields on the order line of the order. The Cascading setup will not work if there is any Processing constraint is defined for restricting changes in Sales Order Header.Oracle has introduced new feature for cascading the Changes in Order Header information to Order Line.</p>
<p><span id="more-7575"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>This feature will bring following advantages:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce Manual Work of updating multiple Lines</li>
<li>Increases productivity</li>
<li>Increases accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Following setup is required for using the Cascading Functionality:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the cascading attributes by setting up the quick codes. This will allow you to define which attributes available for Cascade using this functionality.<br />
** Please note that if the attributes are not enabled in Quick Code system will not Cascade the changes made at header level automatically to Sales Order Lines</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Navigation:</strong></span></p>
<p>Setup → Quick Codes → Order Management</p>
<p>Select Type = OM_HEADER_TO_LINE_CASCADE</p>

<p>In above case we have enabled Payment Term. This will cascade the changes in Payment Terms on Order Line. However the changes will not be cascaded for Sales Person as the Sales person attribute is not enabled.</p>
<p>In addition to Quick codes for using the cascading functionality we also need to set the new profile option in R12 OM: Sales Order Form: Cascade Header Changes to Line.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Oracle provides 3 values for the profile option:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic</li>
<li>Manual</li>
<li>Ask Me</li>
</ul>

<li>Require the team submit regular progress reports.</li>

<li>Develop competence to be a subject matter expert for the team.</li>

<li>Do not criticize a subordinate in front of others. This will affect prestige and morale.</li>
<li>Show interest in what your team is doing. If the team leader is not interested, why should the staff be?</li>
<li>Reward subordinates for a good work. Help them, advise them and stimulate them to do a good job.</li>
<li>Be responsible for the success and failures of your team. The team members should not be the ones to blame.</li>

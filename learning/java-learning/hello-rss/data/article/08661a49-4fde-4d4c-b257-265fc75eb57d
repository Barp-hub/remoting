When trying to compile forms on a R12 refreshed environment in which previously there was no issue, the following error began to show:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: PLSql; toolbar: false;">ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve the connect specifier specified</pre>
<br />
Even if trying to provide a database alias with @alias for the userid parameter, the error persisted.<br />
<br />
To solve the issue, let your DBA's know to follow instructions on the following Metalink note:<br />

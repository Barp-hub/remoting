As a way to avoid a bounce to kick everybody out for maintenance, or just to have fun kicking out people from QA at random, a feature of the eBS logged in users session table, ICX_SESSIONS can be leveraged.<br />
<br />
From the Best Practices for Securing the E-Business Suite [ID 189367.1] document, on an example on implementing a policy for dealing with multiple user logins:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The subscription calls a rule function that updates the ICX_SESSIONS table setting the DISABLED_FLAG='Y' for all other sessions for the user. This renders the other sessions invalid. The next user action returns the browser to a login screen indicating the session is invalid.</blockquote>
As can be seen in this post lead picture, the user sessions is effectively terminated and the user has to log back in, not like a timeout that keeps the current session active.<br />
<br />
As said, this can be used to put some limitations on the system, then terminate sessions and whenever users log back in, the limitations will be in place, i.e. when doing a monthly close to disable clerical responsibilities to avoid getting in more transactions.<br />
<br />
Care should be had on what sessions are terminated, to avoid terminating those that should remain active. The table has plenty of information regarding who is in, the basic one being USER_ID, which you can use to craft the conditions to be used on the WHERE clause when running this.<br />
<br />
Beware that even if there is a RESPONSIBILITY_ID column, it only gets updated when using the OAF menu, not the GUI one, so it is not reliable to filter sessions to terminate.<br />
<br />
To test, you can get your SESSION_ID or LOGIN_ID from the examine menu to find your session and see how information changes there as you interact in the application.<br />

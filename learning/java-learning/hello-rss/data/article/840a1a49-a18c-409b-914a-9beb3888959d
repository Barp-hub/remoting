Best practices to run Oracle 10g/11g RAC on Oracle VM 2.2 are posted in this article.  Virtualization is one of the hot topics in Oracle world too. Now that they are multiple virtual solutions, the question of comparison obviously raises.  Out of VMware Server, VMware ESXi (Hypervisor), Oracle Virtual Box, and Oracle VM, I found Oracle VM suites best for my requirements (performance is key for me).  I am pretty impressed with Oracle VM Performance.   Comparing or benchmarking performance of these virtual solutions isn’t my topic now.<br><br>I have observed a few problems with node evictions on Oracle VM Guests. So, it took some tuning in Oracle VM to get the stability with RAC and avoid node evictions. Only tuning is covered here.. Step by step installation of Oracle 10gR2 RAC on Oracle VM Server is available <a href="http://www.freeoraclehelp.com/2011/09/oracle-10g-rac-installation-on-linux.html">Here</a><br><br>The following are the server names:<br>Oracle VM Server (Dom-0):    ovm.freeoraclehelp.com <br>Oracle RAC Node1 (VM Guest): rac1.freeoraclehelp.com <br>Oracle RAC Node2 (VM Guest): rac2.freeoraclehelp.com <br><br><b>Network Requirements</b><br>Oracle RAC Servers (VM Guests) needs at least two network interfaces. Of course, you may want to bond multiple interfaces in real/production scenario.  One for public network, which drives almost all traffic to your server (ie. connections to server, VIP, and SCAN) and another for private interconnection, which is exclusively used by Oracle RAC for inter communication traffic.<br><br>Oracle VM builds XENBridges on physical interfaces and these bridges can be used in VM guests. So, to support two interfaces at guest, we need at least two bridges on Oracle VM Server. Oracle VM Server installation creates multiple network bridges based on physical network interfaces present in the server. My server has got two network interfaces, so Oracle VM created two network bridges(xenbr0 &amp; xenbr1) by default.<br><a href="http://www.freeoraclehelp.com/2011/09/tuning-oracle-vm-xen-for-oracle-10g-11g.html#more">Read more »</a>

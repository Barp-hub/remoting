While testing some code migrated to R12, it was noticed that some of it had issues with retrieving information secured by the multi-org feature, even if MOAC is not being used. After looking for info, the following was found in the Multiple Organizations implementation guide:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
A new field Operating Unit Mode is included to the Define Concurrent Programs 
window which allows users to specify the concurrent programs for multiple 
organizations. The concurrent programs can be categorized into Single, Multiple or 
Null. The default value is Null. The concurrent program is used to execute the multiple 
organizations initialization and also determine when to display Operating Unit field in 
the Submit Requests window and Schedule Requests window.
There are two categories of Concurrent programs:<br />
1.  Single Organization Concurrent Programs<br />
2.  Multiple Organization Concurrent Programs</blockquote>
<br />
Migrated concurrent program definitions do not get assigned a value for the new field, thus having issues when value sets deal with multi-org security, i.e. a query used to assign a default value not retrieving information vs. no issues when the same is used on a seeded program.<br />
<br />
In order to set the value, though, the System Administration (not Administrator) responsibility has to be used. Use single if MOAC is not enabled and Multiple otherwise.<br />
<br />
From the navigator, select Concurrent&gt;Program, then search for the program that is having issues and click the pencil icon on the results table.<br />
<br />
On the details page, select the request tab and on the "Operating Unit Mode" LOV, select the appropriate value.<br />
<br />

A similar issue was found on a OA Framework page, which seemed to work ok initially, but that was not retrieving information when switching to another responsibility for the same organization within the same session.<br />
<br />
Turns out, there is also a MULTIORG_ENABLED setting, with possible values M (multiple) and S (single) that has to be assigned as a custom property to the application module containing the view objects that require to use Multi-Org security. This setting is not on the OAF Developer's guide, I found it on the following site: <a href="http://mukx.blogspot.com/2009/04/moacmulti-org-access-control-in-oa.html" target="_blank">Mukul's Oracle Technology Blog</a>.<br />
<br />
For additional reference, the following metalink note is quite thorough, particularly if using MOAC:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Oracle Applications Multiple Organizations Access Control for Custom Code [ID 420787.1]</blockquote>
Also,&nbsp;"This document supplements the OA coding standards.", including the setting that I found on Mukul's blog.<br />

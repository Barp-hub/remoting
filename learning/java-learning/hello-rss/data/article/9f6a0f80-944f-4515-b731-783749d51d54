Step by step procedure for installing Oracle 11g (11gR2, 11.2.0.2) Real Application Clusters (RAC) on Linux (OEL 5.5) without SCAN, DNS,NTP setup and with GNS and CTSS is describe here. You can pretty much run this installation on a desktop pc at home. I have used Oracle VM linux guests in this exercise. As always, do let me know any questions or comments you might have.   <ul>  <li><a title="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> </li>   <li><a href="#preinstall">Pre-install tasks</a> </li>   <li><a href="#grid">Install grid infrastructure</a> </li>   <li><a href="#database">Install database software and create database</a> </li>   <li><a href="#dbconsole">Oracle Enterprise Manager (dbconsole)</a> </li></ul> <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>Oracle 11gR2 has brought in a few new features. Couple of interesting new features and notes about 11g grid infrastructure:</p> <ul>  <li>Patch set installation: Starting with 11.2.0, direct upgrades to the most recent patch set are supported, meaning you don’t have to install 11.2.0 and apply patch set to get it to 11.2.0.2. You can directly perform the 11.2.0.2 installation. Download the installable from patch 10098816 in My Oracle Support. </li>   <li>Out-of-place upgrades for CRS/Grid home are supported. CRS/Grid goes into a seperate , new oracle home, instead of same CRS home as before. </li>   <li>Oracle Automatic Storage Management Cluster File System (Oracle ACFS) is introduced. We know that ASMLib is integrated with OS kernel. ACFS is one step further, offering ASM disks as OS cluster file system. Regular file systems are needed for Oracle binaries, needing another LVM for these regular file systems. With ACFS, you do not need any other LVM to manage oracle storage (let it be binaries, data files, etc..) </li>   <li>ASM and CRS are delivered into the same home, now called Grid Home </li></ul><a href="http://www.freeoraclehelp.com/2011/09/oracle-11gr2-rac-installation-with-gns.html#more">Read more »</a>
